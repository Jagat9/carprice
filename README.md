CAR PRICE PREDICTION
This project uses machine learning to predict the price of a car based on certain input parameters. The machine learning model is built using Scikit Learn and Pandas, while the APIs are built using Flask.

Prerequisites:
Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

Scikit Learn
Pandas
Flask


Project Structure:
This project has four major parts:

model.py - This file contains the code for the machine learning model to predict car prices based on the training data in the car Data.csv file.
app.py - This file contains the Flask APIs that receive car details through GUI or API calls, computes the predicted value based on our model, and returns it.
templates - This folder contains the HTML template to allow the user to enter car details and displays the predicted selling price.
model.pkl - This pickle file contains the finalized model that is used by the Flask APIs to predict car prices.
requirements.txt - This file contains the list of dependencies required to run the project. You can install them using the following 
This will start the Flask server and make the APIs available. You can then go to http://localhost:5000 in your browser to access the GUI and enter car details to get a predicted selling price.
